## Emulate a three button mouse
Oh... you don't have your mouse ? It was told you to bring one ! >:(
Well, you can't go far in Blender without a three button mouse, so let's try something against it.

Go to Preferences

Then go to the Input tab

And enable "Emulate 3 Buttons Mouse"
This will enable you to use the middle click by using `ALT + LEFT-CLICK`
