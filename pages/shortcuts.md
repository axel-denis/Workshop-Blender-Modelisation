# Shortcuts

Blender is all about shortcuts.
Yes, menus exists buuuuuuuuut... Think of it like a game, you don't use menus to jump or move, you use your keyboard ! Same in Blender, doing it all by menus is waaaaaay to long.

We will cover here some of the most used shortcuts.
If you are looking for the "shorcut version" of a menu, just hover over it and Blender will show you the shortcut ! (In most cases)

## Basics

### Rotate point of view
Middle mouse button click, then move your mouse.
([Don't have a mouse with a middle button ?](./emulate_mouse.md))

### Select an object
left click (did you really needed me for that ?)

### Move an object
**G** (G for Grab)

### Rotation
**R**

### Scale
**S**

### Important note
Moving, Rotating and Scalling can be counter intuitive at the begining because they all depend on your field of view. This can seems unnatural. But, Blender has you covered ! You can snap your modification to one (or many) axes of the world (X, Y or Z)
Try it ! Select an object, press G, THEN press X (or Y, or Z). The object will move only on the selected axis.

Press `SHIFT + [X,Y,Z]` to select both BUT the axis given.
